![Alt text](Imgs/applepie.jpg?raw=true "Title")

This library is a set of C++ classes meant to be compiled
into your application.  The base classes allow access
to the raspberry pi peripherals and some basic application
support functionality like predefined init and uninit.

Many ideas and some code snippets taken from:
