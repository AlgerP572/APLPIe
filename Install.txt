How to install APLPIe
=======================

The source code provided in this package is meant to be compiled into
another application.  It provides a set of C++ classes for accessing
the peripherals on a raspberry pi.

To build a link a particuar revision of the application the APLPIe library
should be included as a git submodule from your main application project.

All source code has been written using visual studio 2017 and solution files
are provided.  Initial support for debugging as root is poor in visual studio.
In order to remotely debug this any code needing root access the following is
recommended. Hopefully in the future support may be a little easier...

 steps are:

 cd /usr/bin

 sudo mv gdb gdborig

 Now you need to create a bash script named gdb with following content.

 sudo nano gdb

 Content of the bash is; (The -E is important!!! visual studio will send
 paths relative to the logon users home directory)

 #!/bin/sh
 sudo -E gdborig $@

 Finally, make the script runnable.

 sudo chmod 0755 gdb

Happy Coding!
